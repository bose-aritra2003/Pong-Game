# Pong Game
* Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics.
* This is a colour remake of the same game, made in python using the Turtle module.
* The right paddle can be moved up or down by using the up and down arrow keys respectively.
* The left paddle can be moved up or down using the w and s keys respectively.
* If one player misses the ball, the other player gets a point.
